# Gender and Migration in the Mexican News Media

This code is part of an ongoing project analyzing the representation of immigrant women in the Mexican news media, particulary the news media in Puebla. 


I have three hypotheses: 

- The news talks about female immigrants less than their actual representation in migratory flows. 
- Female immigrants are characterized as paassive, gendered, racialized victims, despite their diverse and dynamic roles. 
- These characterizations are more or less nuanced depending on the origins of the women, her location, and the stage in the migratory process. 



## Mock Results for "Keyword Searching"

*PACKAGES USED:* 

requests, BeautifulSoup, nltk.corpus, nltk.tokenize, cucco, seaborn, collections, matplotlib.pyplot


*INPUT:* 

1) Urls from news articles

2) Indicate whether searching sentences for immigrant-related keywords or gender-related keywords


*OUTPUT:*

Two barplots that indicate the most frequent words that appeared in the same sentence as the keywords. 

See [Migrant Keywords Chart](https://github.com/khahnmad/Gender-and-Migration-in-the-Mexican-News-Media/blob/master/Migrant%20Keywords%20Chart.png) and [Gendered Keywords Chart](https://github.com/khahnmad/Gender-and-Migration-in-the-Mexican-News-Media/blob/master/Gendered%20Keywords%20Chart.png) for these barplots. 



## Mock Results for "Hypothesis A"

*PACKAGES USED:*  

numpy, requests, BeautifulSoup, Cucco, nltk.corpus, nltk, nltk.tokenize, urllib.request

*OUTPUT:*

The 20 most common words from the three articles fed into the program in the beginning

migrantes: 5 derechos: 3 Destacó: 2 organización: 2 Por: 2 ejemplo: 2 Puebla: 2 medalla: 2 defensor: 2 aseveró: 2 una: 2 mundo: 2 haga: 2 labor: 1 director: 1 Saber: 1 Es: 1 Poder: 1 favor: 1 ser: 1
